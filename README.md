## 3. Compare and contrast Agile and Waterfall methodologies. What are the main advantages and disadvantages of each?

Agile and Waterfall are two widely used software development methodologies, each with distinct approaches. Agile follows an iterative and flexible process, where projects are divided into smaller cycles called sprints. It encourages continuous customer feedback, allowing changes at any stage of development. This method is best suited for dynamic projects with evolving requirements, though it requires constant client involvement and can be difficult to estimate costs and timelines.

In contrast, Waterfall follows a linear and sequential approach, where each phase is completed before moving to the next. It is ideal for projects with clear, fixed requirements, offering a structured process with extensive documentation. However, its rigid nature makes accommodating changes difficult, and issues are often identified late, which can increase project risks.

Agile provides faster delivery and greater flexibility, while Waterfall offers predictability and is easier to manage for fixed-budget projects. The choice between the two depends on the project’s complexity, client involvement, and the likelihood of changing requirements.

## 4. In what types of projects might Agile be more beneficial than Waterfall, and vice versa? Can you provide examples of each?

Agile is more beneficial for dynamic, fast-changing projects where requirements are likely to evolve during development. It works best for projects that require continuous feedback, flexibility, and rapid delivery. Examples include:

Software product development (e.g., mobile apps, e-commerce websites)
Startups creating MVPs (Minimum Viable Products)
Custom web applications with evolving user needs
AI and machine learning projects requiring frequent testing and adjustments
On the other hand, Waterfall is ideal for well-defined, structured projects where requirements are fixed from the start. It suits projects with clear deliverables, strict deadlines, and minimal changes expected. Examples include:

Government or defense projects with detailed specifications
Banking software systems with strict compliance requirements
Construction project management tools
Enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems

Agile fits innovative, customer-driven projects, while Waterfall is better for predictable, heavily regulated projects with clear objectives.

## 5. What are some methods for ensuring quality assurance throughout a software project? Why is it important to maintain high standards?

Methods for Ensuring Quality Assurance in Software Projects
Ensuring quality assurance (QA) throughout a software project is essential to deliver reliable, efficient, and user-friendly products. Key methods include:

Requirement Analysis:
